# Haskell playground

Just a place to collect code I write to explore the Haskell language. I often need to write sample code to follow some article, and decided to start collecting it in a gt repo

It's very unlikely this will be to any use to anyone else, but don't have any reason to hide it
some files are runnable without compiling, most have executable bits you can execute in file with vscode, some both:

```haskell
-- vscode will show you a codelens to run the followinf line
-- >>> 2+1
-- 3 -- this line will be refreshed when you run the code above

```

Most of this is [public domain](https://unlicense.org/), check individual files for exemptions
